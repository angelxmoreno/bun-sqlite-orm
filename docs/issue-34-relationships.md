# Issue #34: Complete Relationship Decorators and Management System

## Overview

This document outlines the prerequisite issues that must be completed before implementing comprehensive relationship support in bun-sqlite-orm. Relationships are a major feature that will enable defining and managing associations between entities using decorators like `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, `@OneToOne`, and `@ManyToMany`.

## Prerequisites Analysis

Based on review of all open GitHub issues, the following issues should be completed before implementing relationships to ensure a solid foundation and avoid architectural conflicts.

### Critical Prerequisites (Must Complete First)

#### 1. Issue [#50](https://github.com/angelxmoreno/bun-sqlite-orm/issues/50): Base class without @Entity decorator creates unwanted table
**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Open  
**Justification:**
- Fundamental entity registration system is broken
- Base classes without @Entity create unwanted tables
- Entity registration ignores DataSource configuration
- Must be fixed before any relationship work as it affects core entity behavior

**Impact if not completed:** Relationship base classes and entity inheritance patterns will not work correctly.

#### 2. Issue [#51](https://github.com/angelxmoreno/bun-sqlite-orm/issues/51): Entity inheritance fails - child entities don't inherit parent class columns
**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Open  
**Justification:**
- Child entities completely missing parent class columns in database schema
- Breaks fundamental inheritance pattern that relationships depend on
- Entities have no primary keys if inherited from parent
- All BaseEntity operations fail on child entities

**Impact if not completed:** Relationship entities cannot properly inherit shared fields, breaking the foundation for relationship implementation.

#### 3. Issue [#9](https://github.com/angelxmoreno/bun-sqlite-orm/issues/9): Add transaction support for atomic operations
**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Open  
**Justification:** 
- Relationships will heavily depend on transactions for data consistency
- Creating/updating related entities must be atomic operations
- Cascade operations (save/delete related entities) require transaction support
- Junction table management for many-to-many relationships needs atomic operations
- Complex object graphs must be saved/updated consistently

**Impact if not completed:** Relationship operations could leave the database in an inconsistent state, leading to data corruption and integrity issues.

#### 4. Issue [#35](https://github.com/angelxmoreno/bun-sqlite-orm/issues/35): Advanced WHERE conditions (gt, lt, like, in, between)
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Open  
**Justification:**
- Relationships require advanced querying capabilities beyond basic equality matching
- JOIN query generation needs complex conditions
- Filtering related entities requires various comparison operators
- Efficient relationship loading strategies depend on advanced WHERE clauses
- Nested relation queries need sophisticated condition building

**Impact if not completed:** Relationship queries would be severely limited, making the feature less useful for real-world applications.

### Important Infrastructure Issues

#### 5. Issue [#26](https://github.com/angelxmoreno/bun-sqlite-orm/issues/26): Optimize Dependencies - Move to Peer Dependencies
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Open  
**Justification:**
- This is a breaking change that requires a major version bump (v2.0.0)
- Better to consolidate breaking changes together rather than separately
- Relationships will add significant complexity, making dependency refactoring harder later
- Clean dependency management before adding major features

**Impact if not completed:** Will require separate major version releases, complicating version management and user upgrades.

### Optional but Beneficial

#### 6. Issue [#25](https://github.com/angelxmoreno/bun-sqlite-orm/issues/25): Complete PinoDbLogger Implementation
**Priority:** Low-Medium  
**Status:** Open  
**Justification:**
- Relationships will generate complex queries that benefit from proper logging
- Debugging relationship loading issues requires detailed query logging
- Performance monitoring of JOIN queries is crucial
- Tracking cascade operations helps with troubleshooting

**Impact if not completed:** Harder to debug relationship issues and optimize performance, but not blocking implementation.

#### 7. Issue [#36](https://github.com/angelxmoreno/bun-sqlite-orm/issues/36): Manual migration file generation and management
**Priority:** Low-Medium  
**Status:** Open  
**Justification:**
- Relationships require schema changes (foreign key constraints, junction tables)
- Index creation for relationship performance optimization
- Better control over relationship schema evolution
- Support for complex migration scenarios with relationships

**Impact if not completed:** Auto-migration will handle basic cases, but complex relationship scenarios may need manual intervention.

## Issues That Should NOT Block [#34](https://github.com/angelxmoreno/bun-sqlite-orm/issues/34)

The following issues can be implemented after relationships are complete:

- **[#39](https://github.com/angelxmoreno/bun-sqlite-orm/issues/39)**: Performance benchmarking - Can measure relationship performance after implementation
- **[#38](https://github.com/angelxmoreno/bun-sqlite-orm/issues/38)**: CLI tools - Developer experience feature, not foundational
- **[#37](https://github.com/angelxmoreno/bun-sqlite-orm/issues/37)**: Entity lifecycle hooks - Can be built on top of relationships
- **[#29](https://github.com/angelxmoreno/bun-sqlite-orm/issues/29)**: Documentation for v2.0.0 - Should be done after major features are complete
- **[#17](https://github.com/angelxmoreno/bun-sqlite-orm/issues/17)**: BLOB support - Specialized feature independent of relationships
- **[#16](https://github.com/angelxmoreno/bun-sqlite-orm/issues/16)**: SQLite extensions - Performance optimization, not core functionality
- **[#15](https://github.com/angelxmoreno/bun-sqlite-orm/issues/15)**: Database serialization - Utility feature that can work with relationships
- **[#14](https://github.com/angelxmoreno/bun-sqlite-orm/issues/14)**: Safe integers - Data type handling, independent of relationships
- **[#13](https://github.com/angelxmoreno/bun-sqlite-orm/issues/13)**: WAL mode - Performance optimization, not foundational
